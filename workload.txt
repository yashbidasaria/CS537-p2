The workload that we ran four different workloads. The processes were run at 80, 70, 90 and 60 million respectively. From looking at the graph we have you can see that all the processes start at priority 0 and as they run for more time ticks their priorities decrease (numerically increase). At prioirty 0 and 1 they get 5 timer ticks, 10 at 2 and 20 at 3. Our upgrade can also been seen on the graph, this occurs when the processes go from 3 to 2 and then also 2 to 1.
